<h3>TRADE REPORT.</h3>
<h4>(FROM OUR OWN REPORTER.)</h4>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/014-01.png"><img src=

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he market has been in a most
extraordinary state all the morning. Our first advices informed us
that feathers were getting very heavy, and that lead was a great
deal brisker than usual. In the fish-market, flounders were not so
flat as they had been, and, to the surprise of every one, were
coming round rapidly.</p>
<p>The deliveries of tallow were very numerous, and gave a
smoothness to the transactions of the day, which had a visible
effect on business. Every species of fats were in high demand, but
the glut of mutton gave a temporary check to the general facility
of the ordinary operations.</p>
<p>The milk market is in an unsettled state, the late rains having
caused an unusual abundance. A large order for skim, for the use of
a parish union, gave liveliness to the latter portion of the day,
which had been exceedingly gloomy during the whole morning.</p>
<p>We had a long conversation in the afternoon with a gentleman who
is up to every move in the poultry-market, and his opinion is, that
the flouring system must soon prove the destruction of fair and
fowl commerce. We do not wish to be premature, but our informant is
a person in whom we place the utmost reliance, and, indeed, there
is every reason why we should depend upon so respectable an
authority.</p>
<p>Cotton is in a dull state. We saw only one ball in the market,
and even that was not in a dealer&rsquo;s hands, but was being used
by a basket-woman, who was darning a stocking. After this, who can
be surprised at the stoppage of the factories?</p>
<p>Nothing was done in gloves, and what few sales were effected,
seemed to be merely for the purpose of keeping the hand in, with a
view to future dealings.</p>

<h2>THE GEOLOGY OF SOCIETY.</h2>
<p>The study of Geology, in the narrow acceptation of the word, is
confined to the investigation of the materials which compose this
terrestrial globe;&mdash;in its more extended signification, it
relates, also, to the examination of the different layers or strata
of society, as they are to be met with in the world.</p>
<p>Society is divided into three great strata, called High
Life&mdash;Middle Life&mdash;and Low Life. Each of these strata
contains several classes, which have been ranged in the following
order, descending from the highest to the lowest&mdash;that is,
from the drawing-room of St. James&rsquo;s to the cellar in St.
Giles&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It will be seen, by a glance at the above table, that the three
great divisions of society, namely, <em>High Life, Low Life</em>,
and <em>Middle Life</em>, are subdivided, or more properly,
sub-classed, into the Superior, Transition, and Metamorphic
classes. Lower still than these in the social scale is the
Primitive Formation&mdash;which may be described as the basis and
support of all the other classes. The individuals comprising it may
be distinguished by their ragged surface, and shocking bad hats;
they effervesce strongly with gin or Irish whiskey. This class
comprehends the <em>St. Giles&rsquo;s Group</em>&mdash;(which is
the lowest of all the others, and is found only in the great London
basin)&mdash;and that portion of the Whitechapel group whose
individuals wear Bluchers and ride in pleasure &lsquo;wans&rsquo;
to Richmond on Sundays. In man&rsquo;s economy the <em>St.
Giles&rsquo;s Group</em> are exceedingly important, being usually
employed in the erection of buildings, where their great durability
and hod-bearing qualities are conspicuous. Next in order is the
Metamorphic class&mdash;so called, because of the singular
metamorphoses that once a week takes place amongst its individuals;
their common every-day appearance, which approaches nearly to that
of the <em>St. Giles&rsquo;s Group</em>, being changed, on Sundays,
to a variegated-coloured surface, with bright buttons and a shining
&ldquo;four-and-nine&rdquo;&mdash;goss. This class includes the
upper portion of the <em>Whitechapel Group</em>, and the two lower
strata of the <em>Clapham Group</em>. The <em>Whitechapel
Group</em> is the most elevated layer of the inferior series. The
Shabby Genteel stratum occupies a wide extent on the Surrey side of
the water&mdash;it is part of the <em>Clapham Group</em>, and is
found in large quantities in the neighbourhood of Kennington,
Vauxhall, and the Old Kent-road. A large vein of it is also to be
met with at Mile-end and Chelsea. It is the lowest of the secondary
formation. This stratum is characterised by its fossil
remains&mdash;a great variety of miscellaneous articles&mdash;such
as watches, rings, and silk waistcoats and snuff-boxes being found
firmly imbedded in what are technically termed <em>avuncular
depositories</em>. The deposition of these matters has been
referred by the curious to various causes; the most general
supposition being, a peremptory demand for rent, or the like, on
some particular occasion, when they were carried either by the
owner, his wife, or daughter, from their original to their present
position, and left amongst an accumulation of &ldquo;popped&rdquo;
articles from various districts. The chief evidence on this point
is not derived from the fossils themselves, but from their
<em>duplicates</em>, which afford the most satisfactory proof of
the period at which they were deposited. Articles which appear
originally to have belonged to the neighbourhood of Belgrave-square
have been frequently found in the depositories of the district
between Bethnal-green and Spitalfields. By what social deluge they
could have been conveyed to such a distance, is a question that has
long puzzled the ablest geologists. Immediately above the
&ldquo;shabby genteel&rdquo; stratum are found the people who
&ldquo;keep a shop concern, but no shay;&rdquo; it is the uppermost
layer of the Metamorphic Class, and, in some instances, may be
detected mingling with the supra-genteel <em>Clapham Group</em>.
The &ldquo;shop and no shay&rdquo; stratum forms a considerable
portion of the London basin. It is characterised by its coarseness
of texture, and a conglomeration of the parts of speech. Its animal
remains usually consist of retired licensed victuallers and obese
tallow-chandlers, who are generally found in beds of soft
formation, separated from superincumbent layers of Marseilles
quilts, by interposing strata of thick double Witneys.</p>
<p>Having proceeded thus far upwards in the social formation, we
shall pause until next week, when we shall commence with the lower
portion of the TRANSITION CLASS&mdash;the &ldquo;shop and shay
people&rdquo;&mdash;and, as we hope, convince our readers of the
immense importance of our subject, and the great advantage of
studying the strata of human life</p>

<h3>COVENTRY&rsquo;S WISE PRECAUTION.</h3>
<p>Some person was relating to the Earl of Coventry the strange
fact that the Earl of Devon&rsquo;s harriers last week gave chase,
in his demesne, to an unhappy donkey, whom they tore to pieces
before they could be called off; upon which his lordship asked for
a piece of chalk and a slate, and composed the following <em>jeu
d&rsquo;esprit</em> on the circumstance:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I&rsquo;m truly shocked that Devon&rsquo;s hounds</p>
<p class="i2">The gentle ass has slain;</p>
<p>For <em>me</em> to shun his lordship&rsquo;s grounds,</p>
<p class="i2">It seems a warning plain.</p>

<h3>CONTINUATIONS FROM CHINA.</h3>
<p>It is generally reported that the usual <em>drill</em>
continuations of the British tars are about to be altered by those
manning the fleet off China, who purpose adopting <em>Nankin</em>
as soon as possible.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE VERY &ldquo;NEXT&rdquo; JONATHAN.</h3>
<p>There is a Quaker in New Orleans so desperate <em>upright</em>
in all his dealings, that he won&rsquo;t sit down to eat his
meals.</p>

<h2>POOR JACK.</h2>
<p>A sailor ashore, after a long cruise, is a natural curiosity.
Twenty-four hours&rsquo; liberty has made him the happiest dog in
existence; and the only drawback to his perfect felicity, is the
difficulty of getting rid of his prize-money within the allotted
time. It must, however, be confessed, that he displays a vast deal
of ingenuity in devising novel modes of spending his rhino.
Watches, trinkets, fiddlers, coaches, grog, and girls, are the
long-established and legitimate modes of clearing out his lockers;
but even these means are sometimes found inadequate to effect the
desired object with sufficient rapidity. When there happens to be a
number of brother-tars similarly employed, who have engaged all the
coaches, fiddlers, and sweethearts in the town, it is then that
Jack is put to his wits&rsquo;-end; and it is only by buying
cocked-hats and top-boots for the boat&rsquo;s-crew, or some such
absurdity, that he can get all his cash scattered before he is
obliged to return on board. This is a picture of a sailor
<em>ashore</em>, but a sailor <em>aground</em> is a different being
altogether. An unlucky shot may deprive him of a leg or arm; he may
be frost-nipped at the pole, or get a <em>coup de soleil</em> in
the tropics, and then be turned upon the world to shape his course
amongst its rocks and shallows, with the bitter blast of poverty in
his teeth. But Jack is not to be beaten so easily; although run
aground, he refuses to strike his flag, and, with a cheerful heart,
goes forth into the highways and byeways to sing &ldquo;the dangers
of the sea,&rdquo; and, to collect from the pitying passers-by, the
coppers that drop, &ldquo;like angel visits,&rdquo; into his little
oil-skin hat.</p>
<p>These nautical melodists, with voices as rough as their beards,
are to be met with everywhere; but they abound chiefly in the
neighbourhood of Deptford and Wapping, where they seem to be
indigenous. The most remarkable specimen of the class may, however,
frequently be seen about the streets of London, carrying at his
back a good-sized box, inside which, and peeping through a sort of
port-hole, a pretty little girl of some two years old exhibits her
chubby face. Surmounting the box, a small model of a frigate, all
a-tant and ship-shape, represents &ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s (God
bless her!) frigate Billy-ruffian, on board o&rsquo; which the
exhibitor lost his blessed limb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&mdash;we call him Jack, though we confess we are uncertain
of his baptismal appellation&mdash;because Jack is a sort of
generic name for his species&mdash;Jack prides himself on his
little Poll and his little ship, which he boasts are the miniature
counterparts of their lovely originals; and with these at his back,
trudges merrily along, trusting that Providence will help him to
&ldquo;keep a southerly wind out of the bread-bag.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s songs, as we have remarked, all relate to the
sea&mdash;he is a complete repository of Dibdin&rsquo;s choice old
ballads and fok&rsquo;sl chaunts. &ldquo;Tom Bowling,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lovely Nan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor Jack,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lash&rsquo;d to the helm,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Cease, rude
Boreas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; are amongst his
favourite pieces, but the &ldquo;Bay of Biscay&rdquo; is his crack
performance: with this he always commenced, when he wanted to
enlist the sympathies of his auditors,&mdash;mingling with the song
sundry interlocutory notes and comments.</p>
<p>Having chosen a quiet street, where the appearance of mothers
with blessed babbies in the windows prognosticates a plentiful
descent of coppers, Jack commences by pitching his voice uncommonly
strong, and tossing Poll and the Billy-ruffian from side to side,
to give an idea of the way Neptune sarves the navy,&mdash;strikes,
as one may say, into deep water, by plunging into &ldquo;The Bay of
Biscay,&rdquo; in the following manner;&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Loud roar&rsquo;d the dreadful thunder&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The rain a deluge pours&mdash;</p>
<p>Our sails were split asunder,</p>
<p class="i2">By lightning&rsquo;s vivid pow&rsquo;rs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do, young gentleman!&mdash;toss a copper to poor little
Poll. Ah! bless you, master!&mdash;may you never want a shot in
your locker. Thank the gentleman, Polly&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The night both drear and dark,</p>
<p>Our poor desarted bark,</p>
<p>There she lay&mdash;(lay quiet, Poll!)</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;There she lay&mdash;Noble lady in the window, look with
pity on poor Jack, and his little Polly&mdash;till next day,</p>
<p>In the Bay of Biscay O.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, kind lady, help the poor shipwrecked
sailor&mdash;cast away on his voyage to the West Ingees, in a
dreadful storm. Sixteen hands on us took to the long-boat, my lady,
and was thrown on a desart island, three thousand miles from any
land; which island was unfortunately manned by Cannibals, who roast
and eat every blessed one of us, except the cook&rsquo;s black boy;
and him they potted, my lady, and I&rsquo;m bless&rsquo;d but
they&rsquo;d have potted me, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t sung out to
them savages, in this &lsquo;ere sort of way, my lady&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Come all you jolly sailors bold,</p>
<p>Whose hearts are cast in honour&rsquo;s mould,</p>
<p>While British valour I unfold&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">Huzza! for the Arethusa!</p>
<p>She was a frigate stout and brave</p>
<p>As ever stemm&rsquo;d the dashing wave&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love your honour, and throw the poor sailor who has
fought and bled for his country, a trifle to keep him from
foundering. Look, your honour, how I lost my precious limb in the
sarvice. You see we was in the little Tollymakus frigate, cruising
off the banks o&rsquo; Newf&rsquo;land, when we fell in with a
saucy Yankee, twice the size of our craft; but, bless your honour,
that never makes no odds to British sailors, and so we sarved her
out with hot dumpling till she got enough, and forced her to haul
down her stripes to the flag of Old England. But somehow, your
honour, I caught a chance ball that threw me on my beam-ends, and
left me to sing&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">&ldquo;My name d&rsquo;ye see&rsquo;s Tom Tough,</p>
<p class="i6">And I&rsquo;ve seen a little sarvice,</p>
<p>Where the mighty billows roll and loud tempests blow,</p>
<p class="i4">I&rsquo;ve sail&rsquo;d with noble Howe,</p>
<p class="i6">And I&rsquo;ve fought with gallant Jarvis,</p>
<p>And in gallant Duncan&rsquo;s fleet I&rsquo;ve
sung&mdash;yo-heave-oh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A sixpence or a shilling rewards Jack&rsquo;s loyalty and
eloquence. A violent tossing of Polly and the ship testify his
gratitude; and pocketing the coin he has collected, he puts about,
and shapes his course for some other port, singing lustily as he
goes&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farewell, POOR JACK!</p>

<h3>THOSE DIVING BELLES! THOSE DIVING BELLES!</h3>
<p>Some of our contemporaries have been dreadfully scandalised at
the indelicate scenes which take place on the sands at Ramsgate,
where, it seems, a sort of joint-stock social bathing company has
been formed by the duckers and divers of both sexes. Situations for
obtaining favourable views are anxiously sought after by elderly
gentlemen, by whom opera glasses and pocket telescopes are much
patronised. Greatly as we admire the investigation of nature in her
unadorned simplicity, Ramsgate would be the last place we should
select, if we were</p>

<p>The following is offered as a brief synopsis of the general

stuffing of all carriages, except the one immediately next the
engine, which will be charged as above.</p>
<h4>STOKERS.</h4>
<p>Same as engineers, but a very liberal allowance made to such as
the trains have passed over more than once, and a considerable

<p>The public will be delighted to learn, there can be no doubt, as
to the elegant acquirements of the various <em>attach&eacute;s</em>

<h2>THE LABOURS OF THE SESSION.</h2>
<p>None but Ministers know what Ministers go through for the pure
love of their country; no person who has not reposed in the
luxuriously-cushioned chairs of the Treasury or Downing-street can
conceive the amount of business Sir Robert and his colleagues have
transacted during the three months they have been in office. The
people, we know, have been crying for bread&mdash;the manufacturers
are starving&mdash;but their rebellious appetites will be
appeased&mdash;their refractory stomachs will feel comforted, when
they are told all that their friends the Tories have been doing for
them. How will they blush for their ingratitude when they find that
the following great measures have been triumphantly carried through
Parliament by Sir Robert&rsquo;s exertions&mdash;The VENTILATING OF
THE HOUSE BILL! Think of that, ye thin-gutted weavers of
Manchester. Drop down on your marrow-bones, and bless the man who
gives your representatives fresh air&mdash;though he denies
you&mdash;a mouthful of coarse food. Then look at his next immense
boon&mdash;The ROYAL KITCHEN-GARDEN BILL! What matters it that the
gaunt fiend Famine sits at your board, when you can console
yourselves with the reflection that cucumbers and asparagus will be
abundant in the Royal Kitchen Garden! But Sir Robert does not stop
here. What follows next?&mdash;The FOREIGN BISHOPS&rsquo; BILL! See
how our spiritual wants are cared for by your tender-hearted
Tories&mdash;they shudder at the thoughts of Englishmen being fed
on foreign corn; but they give them instead, a full supply of
Foreign Bishops. After that comes&mdash;The REPORT OF THE
LUNATICS&rsquo; BILL. This important document has been founded on
the proceedings in the Upper House, and is likely to be of vast
service to the nation at large. Next follows the EXPIRING
LAWS&rsquo; BILL! We imagine that a slight error has been made in
the title of this bill, and that it should be read &ldquo;Expiring
<em>Justice</em> Bill!&rdquo; As to expiring laws&mdash;&lsquo;tis
all a fallacy. One of the glorious privileges of the English
Constitution is, that the laws never expire&mdash;neither do the
lawyers&mdash;they are everlasting. Justice may die in this happy
land, but law&mdash;never!</p>
<p>Again, there is a little grant of some thousands for Prince
Albert&rsquo;s stables and dog-kennels! Very proper too; these
animals must be lodged, ay, and fed; and the people&mdash;the
creatures whom God made after his own image&mdash;the poor wretches
who want nothing but a little bread, will lie down hungry and
thankful, when they reflect that the royal dogs and horses are in
the best possible condition. But we have not yet mentioned the
great crowning work of Ministers&mdash;the Queen&rsquo;s speech on
the Prorogation of the Parliament last week. What an admirable
illustration it was of that profound logical deduction&mdash;that,
out of nothing comes nothing! Yet it was deduction&mdash;that, out
of nothing comes nothing! Yet it was not altogether without design,
and though some sneering critics have called the old song&mdash;the
burthen of it was clearly&mdash;</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S NEW GENERAL LETTER-WRITER.</h2>
<p>Perhaps no one operation of frequent recurrence and absolute
necessity involves so much mental pain and imaginative uneasiness
as the reduction of thoughts to paper, for the furtherance of
epistolatory correspondence. Some great key-stone to this abstruse
science&mdash;some accurate data from which all sorts and
conditions of people may at once receive instruction and
assistance, has been long wanting.</p>
<p>Letter-writers, in general, may be divided into two great
classes, viz.: those who write to ask favours, and those who write
to refuse them. There is a vague notion extant, that in former days
a third genus existed&mdash;though by no means proportionate to the
other two&mdash;they were those who wrote &ldquo;to grant
favours;&rdquo; these were also remarkable for enclosing
remittances and paying the double postage&mdash;at least, so we are
assured; of our knowledge, we can advance nothing concerning them
and their (to us) supposititious existence, save our conviction
that the race has been long extinct.</p>
<p>Those who write to ask, may be divided into&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>&mdash;Creditors.</li>
<li>&mdash;Constituents.</li>
<li>&mdash;Sons.</li>
<li>&mdash;Daughters.</li>

<li>&mdash;Nephews, nieces.</li>
<li>&mdash;Indistinct cousins, and</li>
<li>&mdash;Unknown, dear, and intimate friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those who write to refuse, are</p>

<li>&mdash;Debtors.</li>

<li>&mdash;Fathers.</li>
<li>&mdash;Mothers.</li>
<li>&mdash;Their kin.</li>
<li>&mdash;Uncles.</li>
<li>&mdash;Aunts.</li>
<li>&mdash;Bilious and distant nabobs, and equally dear friends,
who will do anything but what the askers want.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are confident of ensuring the everlasting gratitude of the
above parties by laying before them the proper formul&aelig; for
their respective purposes; and, therefore, as all the world is
composed of two great classes, which, though they run into various
ramifications, still retain their original distinguishing
characteristics&mdash;namely, that of being either
&ldquo;debtors&rdquo; or &ldquo;creditors&rdquo;&mdash;we will give

earnest wish of my eldest son to be in town, for the pleasure of
being near such a representative, which alone induces him to accept
the situation of landing-waiter you so kindly insisted upon his

<h2>THE BARBER OF STOCKSBAWLER.</h2>
<h3>A TALE OF THE SUPERNATURAL.</h3>
<p>At the little town of Stocksbawler, on the Lower Rhine, in the
year of grace 1830, resided one Hans Scrapschins, an industrious
and close-shaving barber. His industry met with due encouragement
from the bearded portion of the community; and the softer sex,
whose greatest fault is fickleness, generally selected Hans for the
honour of new-fronting them, when they had grown tired of the
ringlets nature had bestowed and which time had frosted.</p>
<p>Hans continued to shave and thrive, and all the careful old
burghers foretold of his future well-doing; when he met with a
misfortune, which promised for a time to shut up his shop and leave
him a beggar. He fell in love.</p>
<p>Neighbours warned Hans of the consequences of his folly; but all
remonstrance was vain. Customers became scarce, wearing out their
patience and their wigs together; the shop became dirty, and winter
saw the flies of summer scattered on his show-board.</p>
<p>Agnes Flirtitz was the prettiest girl in Stocksbawler. Her eyes
were as blue as a summer&rsquo;s sky, her cheeks as rosy as an
autumn sunset, and her teeth as white as winter&rsquo;s snow. Her
hair was a beautiful flaxen&mdash;not a <em>drab</em>&mdash;but
that peculiar sevenpenny-moist-sugar tint which the poets of old
were wont to call golden. Her voice was melodious; her notes in
<em>alt</em> were equal to Grisi&rsquo;s: in short, she would have
been a very desirable, loveable young lady, if she had not been a
coquette.</p>
<p>Hans met her at a festival given in commemoration of the demise
of the burgomaster&rsquo;s second wife&mdash;I beg pardon, I mean
in celebration of his union with his third bride. From that day
Hans was a lost barber. Sleeping, waking, shaving, curling,
weaving, or powdering, he thought of nothing but Agnes. His
love-dreams placed him in all kinds of awkward predicaments. And
Agnes&mdash;what thought she of the unhappy barber? Nothing, except
that he was a presumptuous puppy, and wore very unfashionable
garments. Hans received an intimation of this latter opinion; and,
after sundry quailings and misgivings, he resolved to dispose of
his remaining stock in trade, and, for once, dress like a
gentleman. The measure had been taken by the tailor, the garments
had been basted and tried on, and Hans was standing at his door in
a state of feverish excitement, awaiting their arrival in a
completed condition (as there was to be <em>f&ecirc;te</em> on the
morrow, at which Agnes was to be present), when a stranger
requested to be shaved. Hans wished him at the &mdash;&mdash; next
barber&rsquo;s; but there was something so unpleasantly positive in
the visitor&rsquo;s appearance, that he had not the power to
object, so politely bowed him into the shop. The stranger removed
his cap, and discovered two very ugly protuberances, one on each
side of his head, and of most unphrenological appearance. Hans
commenced operations&mdash;the lather dried as fast as he laid it
on, and the razor emitted small sparks as it encountered the
bristles on the stranger&rsquo;s chin, Hans felt particularly
uncomfortable, and not a word had hitherto passed on either side,
when the stranger broke the ice by asking, rather abruptly,
&ldquo;Have you any schnapps in the house?&rdquo; Hans jumped like
a parched pea. Without waiting for a reply, the stranger rose and
opened the cupboard. &ldquo;I never take anything stronger than
water,&rdquo; said Hans, in reply, to the &ldquo;pshaw!&rdquo;
which broke from the stranger&rsquo;s lips as he smelt at the
contents of a little brown pitcher. &ldquo;More fool you,&rdquo;
replied his customer. &ldquo;Here taste that&mdash;some of the
richest grape-blood of Rheingau;&rdquo; and he handed Hans a small
flask, which the sober barber respectfully declined. &ldquo;Ha! ha!
and yet you hope to thrive with the women,&rdquo; said the
stranger. &ldquo;No wonder that Agnes treats you as she does. But
drink, man! drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger took a pipe, and coolly seated himself again in his
chair, hung one leg over the back of another, and striking his
finger briskly down his nose, elicited a flame that ignited his
tobacco, and then he puffed, and puffed, till every moth in the
shop coughed aloud. The uneasiness of Hans increased, and he looked
towards the door with the most cowardly intention; and, lo! two
laughing, dimpled faces, were peeping in at them. &ldquo;Ha! how
are you?&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;come in! come in!&rdquo;
and to Hans&rsquo; horror, two very equivocal damsels entered the
shop. Hans felt scandalised, and was about to make a most powerful
remonstrance, when he encountered the eye of his impertinent
customer; and, from its sinister expression, he thought it wise to
be silent. One of the damsels seated herself upon the
stranger&rsquo;s knee, whilst the other looked most coaxingly to
the barber; who, however, remained proof to all her winks and
blinks, and &ldquo;wreathed smiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sblitzen!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, &ldquo;the
man&rsquo;s an icicle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, you&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo; said the stranger; and
his enamorata concurred in the opinion. The flask was again
proffered&mdash;the eye-artillery again brought into action, but
Hans remained constant to pump-water and Agnes Flirtitz.</p>
<p>The stranger rubbed the palm of his hand on one of his head
ornaments, as though he were somewhat perplexed at the contumacious
conduct of the barber; then rising, he gracefully led the ladies
out. As he stood with one foot on the step of the door, he turned
his head scornfully over his shoulder, and said, &ldquo;Hans, you
are nothing but&mdash;a barber; but before I eat, you shall repent
of your present determination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What security have I that you will keep your word?&rdquo;
replied Hans, who felt emboldened by the outside situation of his
customer, and the shop poker, of which he had obtained
possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the world,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;Here, take these!&rdquo; and placing both rows of his teeth
in the hands of the astonished Hans, he quietly walked up the
street with the ladies.</p>
<p>The astonishment of Hans had somewhat subsided, when Stitz, the
tailor, entered with the so-much and the so-long-expected garments.
The stranger was forgotten; the door was bolted, the clothes tried
on, and they fitted to a miracle. A small three-cornered piece of
looking-glass was held in every direction by the delighted tailor,
who declared this performance his <em>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</em>
and Hans felt, for the first time in his life, that he looked like
a gentleman. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, or the slightest
hint at discount for ready money, he gave the tailor his last
thaler, and his old suit of clothes, as per contract; shook
Stitz&rsquo;s hand at parting, till every bone of the
tailor&rsquo;s fingers ached for an hour afterwards, bolted the
door, and went to bed the poorest, but happiest barber in
Stocksbawler.</p>
<p>After a restless night, Hans rose the next morning with the
oddest sensation in the world. He fancied that the bed was shorter,
the chairs lower, and the room smaller, than on the preceding day;
but attributing this feeling to the feverish sleep he had had, he
proceeded to put on his pantaloons. With great care he thrust his
left leg into its proper division, when, to his horror and
amazement, he found that he had grown <em>two feet at least during
the night</em>; and that the pantaloons which had fitted so
admirably before, were now only knee-breeches. He rushed to the
window with the intention of breaking his neck by a leap into the
street, when his eye fell upon the strange customer of the
preceding day, who was leaning against the gable-end of the house
opposite, quietly smoking his meerschaum. Hans paused; then
thought, and then concluded that having found an appetite, he had
repented of his boast at parting, and had called for his teeth.
Being a good-natured lad, Hans shuffled down stairs, and opening
the door, called him to come over. The stranger obeyed the summons,
but honourably refused to accept of his teeth, except on the
conditions of the wager. To Hans&rsquo; great surprise he seemed
perfectly acquainted with the phenomenon of the past night, and
good-naturedly offered to go to Stitz, and inform him of the
barber&rsquo;s dilemma. The stranger departed, and in a few moments
the tailor arrived, and having ascertained by his inch measure the
truth of Hans&rsquo; conjectures, bade him be of good cheer, as he
had a suit of clothes which would exactly fit him. They had been
made for a travelling giant, who had either forgotten to call for
them, or suspected that Stitz would require the <em>gelt</em>
before he gave up the broadcloth.</p>
<p>The tailor was right&mdash;they did fit&mdash;and in an hour
afterwards Hans was on his way to the <em>f&ecirc;te</em>. When he
arrived there many of his old friends stood agape for a few
moments: but as stranger things had occurred in Germany than a man
growing two feet in one night, they soon ceased to notice the
alteration in Hans&rsquo; appearance. Agnes was evidently struck
with the improvement of the barber&rsquo;s figure, and for two
whole hours did he enjoy the extreme felicity of making
half-a-dozen other young gentlemen miserable, by monopolising the
arm and conversation of the beauty of Stocksbawler. But pleasure,
like fine weather, lasts not for ever; and, as Hans and Agnes
turned the corner of a path, his eye again encountered the
stranger. Whether it was from fear or dislike he knew not, but his
heart seemed to sink, and so did his body; for to his utter dismay,
he found that he had shrunk to his original proportions, and that
the garment of the giant hung about him in anything but graceful
festoons. He felt that he was a human telescope, that some infernal
power could elongate or shut up at pleasure.</p>
<p>The whole band of jealous rivals set up the &ldquo;Laughing
Chorus,&rdquo; and Agnes, in the extremity of her disgust, turned
up her nose till she nearly fractured its bridge, whilst Hans
rushed from the scene of his disgrace, and never stopped running
until he opened the door of his little shop, threw himself into a
chair, and laid his head down upon an old &ldquo;family
Bible&rdquo; which chanced to be upon the table. In this position
he continued for some time, when, on raising his head, he found his
tormentor and the two ladies, grouped like the Graces, in the
centre of the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Scrapshins,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;I
have called for my teeth. You see I have kept my promise.&rdquo;
Hans sighed deeply, and the ladies giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, man, never look so glum! Here, take the
flask&mdash;forget Agnes, and console yourself with the love
of&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The conclusion of this harangue must for ever remain a mystery;
for Hans, at this moment, took up the family volume which had
served him for a pillow, and dashed it at the heads of the trio. A
scream, so loud that it broke the tympanum of his left ear, seemed
to issue from them simultaneously&mdash;a thick vapour filled the
room, which gradually cleared off, and left no traces of
Hans&rsquo; visitors but three small sticks of stone brimstone. The
truth flashed upon the barber&mdash;his visitor was the far-famed
Mephistopheles. Hans packed up his remaining wardrobe, razor,
strop, soap-dish, scissors and combs, and turned his back upon
Stocksbawler forever. Four years passed away, and Hans was again a
thriving man, and Agnes Flirtitz the wife of the doctor of
Stocksbawler. Another year passed on, and Hans was both a husband
and a father; but the coquette who had nearly been his ruin had
eloped with the <em>chasseur</em> of a travelling nobleman.</p>

<h3>LAURIE ON GEOGRAPHY.</h3>
<p>Sir P. Laurie has sent to say that he has looked into Dr.
Farr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Medical Guide to Nice,&rdquo; and is much
disappointed. He hoped to have seen a print of the eternally-talked
of &ldquo;<em>Nice</em> Young Man,&rdquo; in the costume of the
country. He doubts, moreover, that the Doctor has ever been there,
for his remarks show him not to have been &ldquo;over

opinion, this must be the origin of the received expression for the
mighty savans, viz., the &ldquo;lights of literature.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PARLIAMENTARY MASONS.&mdash;PARLIAMENTARY PICTURES.</h2>
<p>Was there ever anything so lucky that the strike of the masons
should have happened at this identical juncture! Parliament is
prorogued. Now, deducting Sir Robert Peel, physician, with his
train of apothecaries and pestle-and-mortar apprentices, who, until
February next, are to sit cross-legged and try to think, there are
at least six hundred and thirty unemployed members of the House of
Commons, turned upon the world with nothing, poor fellows! but
grouse before them. Some, to be sure, may pick their teeth, in the
Gardens of the Tuileries&mdash;some may even now venture to
exercise their favourite elbow at Baden-Baden,&mdash;but with every
possible and probable exception, there will yet be hundreds of
unemployed law-makers, to whom time will be a heavy porter&rsquo;s
burden.</p>
<p>We have a plan which, for its originality, should draw down upon
us the gratitude of the nation. It is no other than this: to make
all Members of Parliament, for once in their lives at least,
useful. The masons, hired to build the new temples of Parliament,
have struck. The hard-handed ingrates,&mdash;let them go! We
propose that, during the prorogation at least, Members of
Parliament, should, like beavers, build their own Houses. In a
word, every member elected to a seat in Parliament should be
compelled, like Robinson Crusoe, to make his own furniture before
he could sit down upon it.</p>
<p>Have we not a hundred examples of the peculiar fitness of the
task, in the habits of what in our human arrogance we call the
lower animals? There is many a respectable spider who would justly
feel himself calumniated by any comparison between him and any one
of twenty Parliamentary lawyers we <em>could</em> name; yet the
spider spins its own web, and seeks its own nook of refuge from the
Reform Broom of Molly the housemaid. And then, the tiny insect, the
ant&mdash;that living, silent monitor to unregarding men&mdash;doth
it not make its own galleries, build with toilsome art its own
abiding place? Does not the mole scratch its own chamber&mdash;the
carrion kite build its own nest! Shall cuckoos and Members of
Parliament alone be lodged at others&rsquo; pains?</p>
<p>Consider the wasp, oh, STANLEY! mark its nest of
paper.&mdash;(it is said, on wasp&rsquo;s paper you are wont to
write your thoughts on Ireland)&mdash;and resolutely seize a
trowel!</p>
<p>Look to the bee, oh, COLONEL SIBTHORP! See how it elaborates its
virgin wax, how it shapes its luscious cone&mdash;and though we
would not trust you to place a brick upon a brick, nevertheless you
may, under instruction, mix the mortar!</p>
<p>Ponder on the rat and its doings, most wise BURDETT&mdash;see
how craftily it makes its hole&mdash;and though you are too
age-stricken to carry a hod, you may at least do this
much&mdash;sift the lime.</p>
<p>But wherefore thus particular&mdash;why should we dwell on
individuals? Pole-cat, weasel, ferret, hedgehog, with all your
vermin affinities, come forth, and staring reproachfully in the
faces of all prorogued Members, bid them imitate your zeal and
pains, and&mdash;the masons having struck&mdash;build their Houses
for themselves.</p>
<p>(We make this proposal in no thoughtless&mdash;no bantering
spirit. He can see very little into the most transparent mill-stone
who believes that we pen these essays&mdash;essays that will endure
and glisten as long, ay as long as the freshest mackerel&mdash;if
he think that we sit down to this our weekly labour in a careless
lackadaisical humour. By no means. Like Sir LYTTON BULWER, when he
girds up his loins to write an apocryphal comedy, we approach our
work with graceful solemnity. Like Sir LYTTON, too, we always dress
for the particular work we have in hand. Sir LYTTON wrote
&ldquo;Richelieu&rdquo; in a harlequin&rsquo;s jacket (sticking
pirate&rsquo;s pistols in his belt, ere he valorously <em>took</em>
whole scenes from a French melo-drama): <em>we</em> penned our last
week&rsquo;s essay in a suit of old canonicals, with a tie-wig
askew upon our beating temples, and are at this moment cased in a
court-suit of cut velvet, with our hair curled, our whiskers
crisped, and a masonic apron decorating our middle man. Having
subsided into our chair&mdash;it is in most respects like the
porphyry piece of furniture of the Pope&mdash;and our housekeeper
having played the Dead March in Saul on our chamber organ (BULWER
wrote &ldquo;The Sea Captain&rdquo; to the preludizing of a
Jew&rsquo;s-harp), we enter on our this week&rsquo;s labour. We
state thus much, that our readers may know with what pains we
prepare ourselves for them. Besides, when BULWER thinks it right
that the world should know that the idea of &ldquo;La
Vaili&egrave;re&rdquo; first hit him in the rotonde of a French
diligence, modest as we are, can we suppose that the world will not
be anxious to learn in what coloured coat we think, and whether,
when we scratch our head to assist the thought that sticks by the
way, we displace a velvet cap or a Truefitt&rsquo;s scalp?)</p>
<p>Reader, the above parenthesis may be skipped or not. Read not a
line of it&mdash;the omission will not maim our argument. So to
proceed.</p>
<p>If we cast our eyes over the debates of the last six months, we
shall find that hundreds of members of the House of Commons have
exhibited the most extraordinary powers of ill-directed labour. And
then their capacity of endurance! Arguments that would have knocked
down any reasonable elephant have touched them no more than would
summer gnats. Well, why not awake this sleeping strength? Why not
divert a mischievous potency into beneficial action? Why should we
confine a body of men to making laws, when so many of them might be
more usefully employed in wheeling barrows? Now there is Mr.
PLUMPTRE, who has done so much to make English Sundays
respectable&mdash;would he not be working far more enduring utility
with pickaxe or spade than by labouring at enactments to stop the
flowing of the Thames on the Sabbath? Might not D&rsquo;ISRAELI be
turned into a very jaunty carpenter, and be set to the light
interior work of both the Houses? His logic, it is confessed, will
support nothing; but we think he would be a very smart hand at a
hat-peg.</p>
<p>As for much of the joinery-work, could we have prettier
mechanics than Sir James GRAHAM and Sir Edward KNATCHBULL? When we
remember their opinions on the Corn Laws, and see that they are a
part of the cabinet which has already shown symptoms of some
approaching alteration of the Bread Tax&mdash;when we consider
their enthusiastic bigotry for everything as it is, and Sir Robert
PEEL&rsquo;S small, adventurous liberality, his half-bashful homage
to the spirit of the age&mdash;sure we are that both GRAHAM and
KNATCHBULL, to remain component members of the Peel Cabinet, must
be masters of the science of dove-tailing; and hence, the men of
men for the joinery-work of the new Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>Again how many members from their long experience in the small
jobbery of committees&mdash;from their profitable knowledge of the
mysteries of private bills and certain other unclean work which
may, if he please, fall to the lot of the English senator&mdash;how
many of these lights of the times might build small monuments of
their genius in the drains, sewerage, and certain conveniences
required by the deliberative wisdom of the nation? We have seen the
plans of Mr. BARRY, and are bound to praise the evidence of his
taste and genius; but we know that the structure, however fair and
beautiful to the eye, must have its foul places; and for the dark,
dirty, winding ways of Parliament&mdash;reader, take a list of her
Majesty&rsquo;s Commons, and running your finger down their names,
pick us out three hundred able-bodied labourers&mdash;three hundred
stalwart night workmen in darkness and corruption. We ask the
country, need it care for the strike of Peto&rsquo;s men (the said
Peto, by the way, is in no manner descended from
<em>Falstaff&rsquo;s</em> retainer), when there is so much
unemployed labour, hungering only for the country&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>We confess to a difficulty in finding among the members of the
present Parliament a sufficient number of stone-squarers. When we
know that there are so few among them who can look upon more than
<em>one side</em> of a question, we own that the completion of the
building may be considerably delayed by employing only members of
Parliament as square workmen: the truth is, having never been
accustomed to the operation, they will need considerable
instruction in the art. Those, however, rendered incapable, by
habit and nature, of the task, may cast rubbish and carry a
hod.</p>
<p>We put it to the patriotism of members of Parliament, whether
they ought not immediately to throw themselves into the arms of
Peto and Grissell, with an enthusiastic demand for tools. If they
be not wholly insensible of the wants of the nation and of their
own dignity, Monday morning&rsquo;s sun will shine upon every man
of her Majesty&rsquo;s majority, for once laudably employed in the
nation&rsquo;s good. How delightful then to saunter near the
works&mdash;how charming then to listen to members of Parliament!
What a picture of senatorial industry! For an Irish speech by
STANLEY, have we not the more dulcet music of his stone-cutting
saw? Instead of an oration from GOULBURN, have we not the shrill
note of his ungreased parliamentary barrow? For the &ldquo;hear,
hear&rdquo; of PLUMPTRE, the more accordant tapping of the
hammer&mdash;for the &ldquo;cheer&rdquo; from INGLIS, the sweeter
chink of the mason&rsquo;s chisel?</p>
<p>And then the moral and physical good acquired by the workmen
themselves! After six days&rsquo; toil, there is scarcely one of
them who will not feel himself wonderfully enlightened on the wants
and feelings of labouring man. They will learn sympathy in the most
efficient manner&mdash;by the sweat of their brow. Pleasant,
indeed, &lsquo;twill be to see CASTLEREAGH lean on his axe, and
beg, with <em>Sly</em>, for &ldquo;a pot of the smallest
ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having, we trust, remedied the evils of the mason&rsquo;s
strike&mdash;having shewn that the fitness of things calls upon the
Commons, in the present dilemma, to build their own house&mdash;we
should feel it unjust to the government not to acknowledge the good
taste which, as we learn, has directed that an estimate be taken of
the disposable space on the walls of the new buildings, to be
devoted to the exalted work of the historical painter. Records of
the greatness of England are to endure in undying hues on the walls
of Parliament.</p>
<p>This is a praiseworthy object, but to render it important and
instructive, the greatest judgment must be exercised in the
selection of subjects; which, for ourselves, we would have to
illustrate the wisdom and benevolence of Parliament. How
beautifully would several of the Duke of WELLINGTON&rsquo;S
speeches paint! For instance, his portrait of a famishing
Englishman, the drunkard and the idler, no other man (according to
his grace) famishing in England! And then the Duke&rsquo;s view of
the shops of butchers, and poulterers, and bakers&mdash;all in the
Dutch style&mdash;by which his grace has lately proved, that if
there be distress, it can certainly not be for want of comestibles!
But the theme is too suggestive to be carried out in a single
paper.</p>
<p>We trust that portraits of members will be admitted. BURDETT and
GRAHAM, half-whig, half-tory, in the style of Death and the Lady,
will make pretty companion pictures.</p>
<p>To do full pictorial justice to the wisdom of the senate,
Parliament will want a peculiar artist: that gifted man CAN be no
other than the artist to PUNCH!</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>III.&mdash;OF HIS GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT.</h3>
<p>For the first two months of the first winter session the fingers
of the new man are nothing but ink-stains and industry. He has duly
chronicled every word that has fallen from the lips of every
professor in his leviathan note book; and his desk teems with
reports of all the hospital cases, from the burnt housemaid, all
cotton-wool and white lead, who set herself on fire reading penny
romances in bed, on one side of the hospital, to the tipsy glazier
who bundled off his perch and spiked himself upon the area rails on
the other. He becomes a walking chronicle of pathological
statistics, and after he has passed six weeks in the wards,
imagines himself an embryo Hunter.</p>
<p>To keep up his character, a new man ought perpetually to carry a
stethoscope&mdash;a curious instrument, something like a sixpenny
toy trumpet with its top knocked off, and used for the purpose of
hearing what people are thinking about, or something of the kind.
In the endeavour to acquire a perfect knowledge of its use he is
indefatigable. There is scarcely a patient but he knows the exact
state of their thoracic viscera, and he talks of enlarged semilunar
valves, and thickened ventricles with an air of alarming
confidence. And yet we rather doubt his skill upon this point; we
never perceived anything more than a sound and a jog, something
similar to what you hear in the cabin of a fourpenny steam-boat,
and especially mistrusted the &ldquo;metallic tinkling,&rdquo; and
the noise resembling a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows blowing into an
empty quart-pot, which is called the <em>bruit de soufflet</em>.
Take our word, when medicine arrives at such a pitch that the
secrets of the human heart can be probed, it need not go any
further, and will have the power of doing mischief enough.</p>
<p>The new man does not enter much into society. He sometimes asks
a few other juniors to his lodgings, and provides tea and shrimps,
with occasional cold saveloys for their refection, and it is
possible he may add some home-made wine to the banquet. Their
conversation is exceedingly professional; and should they get
slightly jocose, they retail anatomical paradoxes, technical puns,
and legendary &ldquo;catch questions,&rdquo; which from time
immemorial have been the delight of all new men in general, and
country ones in particular.</p>
<p>But diligent and industrious as the new man may be, he is mortal
after all, and being mortal, is not proof against
temptation&mdash;at least, after five or six weeks of his pupilage
have passed. The good St. Anthony resisted all the endeavours of
the Evil One to lure him from the proper path, until the gentleman
of the discoloured <em>cutis vera</em> assumed the shape of a
woman. The new man firmly withstands all inducements to
irregularity until his first temptation appears in the form of the
Cyder-cellars&mdash;the convivial Rubicon which it is absolutely
necessary for him to pass before he can enrol himself as a member
of the quiet, hard-working, modest fraternity of the Medical
Student of our London Hospitals.</p>
<p><em>Facilis descensus Averni.</em>&mdash;The steps that lead
from Maiden-lane to the Cyder-cellars are easy of descent, although
the return is sometimes attended with slight difficulty. Not that
we wish to compare our favourite <em>souterrain</em> in question to
the &ldquo;Avernus&rdquo; of the Latin poet; oh, no! If &AElig;neas
had met with roast potatoes and stout during his celebrated voyage
across the Styx to the infernal regions, and listened to songs and
glees in place of the multitude of condemned souls,
&ldquo;horrendum stridens,&rdquo; we wager that he would have been
in no very great hurry to return. But we have arrived at an
important point in our physiology&mdash;the first launch of the new
man into the ocean of his London life, and we pause upon its shore.
He has but definite ideas of three public establishments at all
intimately connected with his professional career&mdash;the Hall,
the College, and the Cyder-cellars. There are but three individuals
to whom he looks with feelings of deference&mdash;Mr. Sayer of
Blackfriars, Mr. Belfour of Lincoln&rsquo;s-inn-fields, and Mr.
Rhodes of Maiden-lane. These are the impersonation of the
Fates&mdash;the arbitrators of his destinies.</p>
<p>As it is customary that an attendance in the Theatre of Lectures
should precede the student&rsquo;s determination to &ldquo;have a
shy at the College,&rdquo; or &ldquo;go up to the Hall,&rdquo; so
is it usual for a visit to one of the theatres to be paid before
going down to the Cyder-cellars. The new man has been beguiled into
the excursion by the exciting narratives of his companions, and
beginning to feel that he is behind the other &ldquo;chaps&rdquo;
(a new man&rsquo;s term) in knowledge of the world, he yields to
the attraction held out; not because he at first thinks it will
give him pleasure so to do, as because it will put him on a level
with those who have been, on the same principle as our rambling
compatriots go to Switzerland and the Rhine. His Mentor is ready in
the shape of a third-season man, and under his protecting influence
he sallies forth.</p>
<p>The theatres have concluded; every carriage, cab, and
&ldquo;coach &lsquo;nhired&rdquo; in their vicinity is in motion;
venders of trotters and ham-sandwiches are in full cry; the bars of
the proximate retail establishments are crowded with thirsty gods;
ruddy chops and steaks are temptingly displayed in the windows of
the supper-houses, and the turnips and carrots in the
freshly-arrived market-carts appear astonished at the sudden
confusion by which they are surrounded. Amidst this confusion the
new man and his friends arrive beneath the beacon which illumines
the entrance of the tavern. He descends the stairs in an agony of
anticipation, and feverishly trips up the six or eight succeeding
ones to arrive at the large room. A song has just concluded, and he
enters triumphantly amidst the thunder of applause, the jingling of
glasses, the imperious vociferations of fresh orders, and an
atmosphere of smoke that pervades the whole apartment, like dense
clouds of incense burning at the altar of the genius of
conviviality.</p>
<p>The new man is at first so bewildered, that it would take but
little extra excitement to render him perfectly unconscious as to
the probability of his standing upon his
<em>occipito-frontalis</em> or <em>plantar fascia</em>. But as he
collects his ideas, he contrives to muster sufficient presence of
mind to order a Welsh rabbit, and in the interim of its arrival
earnestly contemplates the scene around him. There is the room
which, in after life, so vividly recurs to him, with its bygone
<em>souvenirs</em> of mirth, when he is sitting up all night at a
bad case in the mud cottage of a pauper union. There are its blue
walls, its wainscot and its pillars, its lamps and ground-glass
shades, within which the gas jumps and flares so fitfully; its two
looking-glasses, that reflect the room and its occupants from one
to the other in an interminable vista. There also is Mr. Rhodes,
bending courteously over the backs of the visiters&rsquo; chairs,
and hoping everybody has got everything to their satisfaction, or
bestowing an occasional subdued acknowledgment upon an
<em>habitu&eacute;</em> who chances to enter; and the professional
gentlemen all laying their heads together at the top of the table
to pitch the key of the next glee; and the waiters bustling up and
down with all sorts of tempting comestibles; and the gentleman in
the Chesterfield wrapper smoking a cigar at the side of the room,
while he leans back and contemplates the ceiling, as if his whole
soul was concentrated in its smoke-discoloured mouldings.</p>
<p>The new man is in ecstasies; he beholds the realization of the
Arabian Nights, and when the harmony commences again, he is fairly
entranced. At first, he is fearful of adding the efforts of his
laryngeal &ldquo;little muscles with the long names&rdquo; to swell
the chorus; but, after the second glass of stout and a &ldquo;go of
whiskey,&rdquo; he becomes emboldened, and when the gentleman with
the bass voice sings about the Monks of Old, what a jovial race
they were, our friend trolls out how &ldquo;they laughed, ha,
ha!&rdquo; so lustily, that he gets quite red in the face from
obstructed jugulars, and applauds, when it has concluded, until
everything upon the table performs a curious ballet-dance, which is
only terminated by the descent of the cruets upon the floor.</p>
<p>The precise hour at which the new man arrives at home, after
this eventful evening, has never been correctly ascertained; having
a latch-key, he is the only person that could give any authentic
information upon this point; but, unfortunately, he never knows
himself. Some few things, however, are universally allowed, namely,
that in extreme cases he is found asleep on the rug at the foot of
the stairs next morning, with the rushlight that was left in the
passage burnt quite away, and all the solder of the candlestick
melted into little globules. More frequently he knocks up the
people of the neighbouring house, under the impression that it is
his own, but that a new keyhole has been fitted to the door in his
absence; and, in the mildest forms of the disease, he drinks up all
the water in his bed-room during the night, and has a propensity
for retiring to rest in his pea-coat and Bluchers, from the
obstinate tenacity of his buttons and straps. The first lecture the
next morning fails to attract him; he eats no breakfast, and when
he enters the dissecting-room about one o&rsquo;clock, his
fellow-students administer to him a pint of ale, warmed by the
simple process of stirring it with a hot poker, with some Cayenne
pepper thrown into it, which he is assured will set to rights the
irritable mucous lining of his stomach. The effect of this remedy
is, to send him into a sound sleep during the whole of the two
o&rsquo;clock anatomical lecture; and awakened at its close by the
applause of the students, he thinks he is still at the
Cyder-cellars, and cries out &ldquo;Encore!&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.</h3>
<p>Having been particularly struck by the infernal smashes that
have recently taken place on several railroad lines, and having
been ourselves forcibly impressed by a tender, which it must be
allowed was rather hard (coming in collision with ourselves), we
have thought over the subject, and have now the following
suggestions to offer:&mdash;</p>
<p>Behind each engine let there be second and third class
carriages, so that, in the event of a smash, second and third class
lives only would be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Let there be a van full of stokers before the first class
carriages; for, as the directors appear to be liberal of the
stokers&rsquo; lives, it is presumed that every railway company has
such a glut of them that they can be spared easily.</p>
<p>As some of the carriages are said to oscillate, from being too
heavy at the top, let a few copies of &ldquo;Martinuzzi&rdquo; be
placed as ballast at the bottom.</p>
<p>In order that the softest possible lining may be given to the
carriages, let the interior be covered with copies of
Sibthorp&rsquo;s speeches as densely as possible.</p>
<p>We have not yet been able to find a remedy for the remarkable
practice which prevails in some railways of sending a passenger,
like a bank-note, <em>cut in half</em>, for better security.</p>

<h2>SPANISH POLITICS.</h2>
<h4>(FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</h4>
<p class="rgt">&ldquo;<em>Pampeluna, Oct. 1.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;An event has just occurred which will doubtless change
the dynasty of the Spanish succession before I have finished my
letter. At eleven o&rsquo;clock this morning, several officers were
amusing themselves at picquet in a coffee-house. One having played
the king, another cried out, &lsquo;Ay, the king! <em>Vivat</em>!
Down with the Queen! Don Carlos for ever!&rsquo; This caused a
frightful sensation, and the National Guards are now on their way
to blockade the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>One o&rsquo;clock</em>, P.M.&mdash;The National
Guards have joined the Carlists, and the regulars are at this
moment flying to arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Two o&rsquo;clock</em>.&mdash;The royal troops are
defeated, and Don Carlos is now being proclaimed King of Spain,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>(FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT.)</h4>
<p class="rgt">&ldquo;<em>Madrid, Oct. 2.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The nominal reign of Don Carlos, commenced at Pampeluna,
has been but of short duration. A diversion has taken place in
favour of the husband of the Queen Regent&mdash;Munos, who, having
been a private soldier, is thought by his rank and file camaradoes
to have a prior claim to Don Carlos. They have revolted to a man,
and the Carlists tremble in their boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Six o&rsquo;clock</em>, A.M.&mdash;The young Queen
has fled the capital&mdash;Munos is our new King, and his throne
will no doubt be consolidated by a vigorous ministry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Seven o&rsquo;clock</em>, A.M.&mdash;News has just
arrived from Pampeluna that the Carlists are so disgusted with the
counter-revolution, that a counter-counter-revolution having taken
place amongst the shopkeepers, in favour of the Queen Regent, the
Carlists have joined it. After all, the Queen Mother will doubtless
permanently occupy the throne&mdash;at least for a day or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Eight o&rsquo;clock</em>.&mdash;News has just arrived
from Biscay of a new revolt, extending through all the Basque
provinces; and they are only waiting for some eligible pretender to
come forward to give to this happy country another ruler. Advices
from all parts are indeed crowded with reports of a rebellious
spirit, so that a dozen revolutions a-week may be assuredly
anticipated during the next twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>OLD MAIDS.</h3>
<p><em>Sir Philip Brilliant</em> is a gentleman of exquisite
breeding&mdash;a man of fashion, with a taste for finery, and
somewhat of a fop. He reveals his pretty figure to us, arrayed in
all the glories of white and pink satins, embellished with
flaunting ribbons, and adorned with costly jewels. His servant is
performing the part of mirror, by explaining the beauties of the
dress, and trying to discover its faults: his researches for flaws
are unavailing, till his master promises him a crown if he can find
one&mdash;nine valets out of ten would make a misfit for half the
money; and <em>Robert</em> instantly pays a tribute to the title of
the play by discovering a <em>wrinkle</em>&mdash;equally an emblem
of an &ldquo;Old Maid&rdquo; and an ill-fitting vest. This incident
shows us that <em>Sir Philip</em> is an amateur in dress; but his
predilection is further developed by his exit, which is made to
scold his goldsmith for the careless setting of a lost diamond. The
next scene takes us to the other side of Temple-bar; in fact, upon
Ludgate-hill. We are inside the shop of the goldsmith, <em>Master
Blount</em>, most likely the founder of the firm now conducted by
Messrs. Rundell and Bridge. He has two sons, who, being brought up
to the same trade, and always living together, are, of course,
eternally quarrelling. Both have a violent desire to cut the shop;
the younger for glory, ambition, and all that (after the fashion of
all city juveniles, who hate hard work), the elder for ease and
elegance. The papa and mamma have a slight altercation on the
subject of their sons, which happily, (for family quarrels seldom
amuse third parties) is put an end to by a second
&ldquo;shine,&rdquo; brought about by the entrance of <em>Sir
Philip Brilliant</em>, to make the threatened complaint about bad
workmanship. The younger and fiery <em>Thomas Blount</em> resents
some of <em>Sir P.B.</em>&rsquo;s expressions to his father; this
is followed by the usual <em>badinage</em> about swords and their
use. We make up our minds that the next scene is to consist of a
duel, and are not disappointed.</p>
<p>Sure enough a little rapier practice ends the act; the shopman
is wounded, and his adversary takes the usual oath of being his
sworn friend for ever.</p>
<p>The second act introduces a new class of incidents. A great
revolution has taken place in the private concerns of the family
Blount. <em>Thomas</em>, the younger, has become a colonel in the
army; John, having got possession of the shop, has sold the
stock-in-trade, fixtures, good-will, &amp;c.; doubtless, to the
late <em>Mr. Rundell&rsquo;s</em> great-grandfather; and has set up
for a private gentleman. For his introduction into genteel society
he is indebted to <em>Robert</em>, whom he has mistaken for a
Baronet, and who presents him to several of his fellow-knights of
the shoulder-knot, all dubbed, for the occasion, lords and ladies,
exactly as it happens in the farce of &ldquo;High Life Below
Stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where are the &ldquo;Old Maids&rdquo; all this time? Where,
indeed! <em>Lady Blanche</em> and <em>Lady Anne</em> are young and
beautiful&mdash;exquisitely lovely; for they are played by Madame
Vestris and Mrs. Nisbett. It is clear, then, that directly they
appear, the spectator assures himself that they are <em>not</em>
the &ldquo;Old Maids.&rdquo; To be sure they seem to have taken a
sort of vow of celibacy; but their fascinating looks&mdash;their
beauty&mdash;their enchanting manners, offer a challenge to the
whole bachelor world, that would make the keeping of such a vow a
crime next to sacrilege. One does not tremble long on that account.
<em>Lady Blanche</em>, has, we are informed, taken to disguising
herself; and some time since, while rambling about in the character
of a yeoman&rsquo;s daughter, she entered <em>Blount&rsquo;s</em>
shop, and fell in love with <em>Thomas</em>: at this exact part of
the narrative <em>Colonel Blount</em> is announced, attended by his
sworn friend, <em>Sir Philip Brilliant</em>. A sort of partial
recognition takes place; which leaves the audience in a dreadful
state of suspense till the commencement of another act.</p>
<p><em>Sir Philip</em>, who has formerly loved <em>Lady
Blanche</em> without success, now tries his fortune with <em>Lady
Anne</em>; and at this point, dramatic invention ends; for,
excepting the mock-marriage of <em>John Blount</em> with a
lady&rsquo;s-maid, the rest of the play is occupied by the
vicissitudes the two pair of lovers go through&mdash;all of their
own contrivance, on purpose to make themselves as wretched as
possible&mdash;till the grand clearing up, which always takes place
in every last scene, from the &ldquo;Adelphi&rdquo; of Terence (or
Yates), down to the &ldquo;Old Maids&rdquo; of Mr. Sheridan
Knowles.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<h3>COCORICO, OR MY AUNT&rsquo;S BANTAM.</h3>
<p>Since playwrights have left off plotting and under-plotting on
their own account, and depend almost entirely upon the
&ldquo;French,&rdquo; managers have added a new member to their
establishments, and, like the morning papers, employ a Paris
correspondent, that French plays, as well as French eggs, may be
brought over quite fresh; though from the slovenly manner in which
they (the pieces, not the eggs) are too often prepared for the
English market, they are seldom <em>neat</em> as imported.</p>
<p>The gentleman who &ldquo;does&rdquo; the Parisian correspondence
for the Adelphi Theatre, has supplied it with a vaudeville bearing
the above title; the fable, of which, like some of
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s, principally concerns a hen, that, however, does
not speak, and a smart cockscomb who does&mdash;an innocent little
fair who has charge of the fowl&mdash;a sort of <em>Justice
Woodcock</em>, and a bombardier who, because he is in the uniform
of a drum or bugle-major, calls himself a serjeant. To these may be
added, Mr. Yates in his own private character, and a few sibilants
in the pit, who completed the poultry-nature of the piece by
playing the part of geese.</p>
<p>The plot would have been without interest, but for the
accidental introduction of the last two characters,&mdash;or the
geese and the cock-of-the-walk.<span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page168" name="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> The pittites,
affronted at the extreme puerility of some of the incidents, and
the inanity of all the dialogue, hissed. This raffled the feathers
of the cock-of-the-walk, who was already on, or rather at, the
wing; and he flew upon the stage in a tantrum, to silence the
geese. Mr. Yates spoke&mdash;we need not say how or what. Everybody
knows how he of the Adelphi shrugs his shoulders, and squeezes his
hat, and smiles, and frowns, and &ldquo;appeals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;declares upon his honour&rdquo; while agitating the buttons
on the left side of his coat, and &ldquo;entreats&rdquo; and
&ldquo;throws himself upon the candour of a British public,&rdquo;
and puts the stamp upon all he has said by an impressive thump of
the foot, a final flourish of the arms, and a triumphal exit to
poean-sounding &ldquo;bravoes!&rdquo; and to the utter confusion of
all dis&mdash;or to be more correct, hiss&mdash;sentients.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the latter triumphed; and <em>Cocorico</em>
deserved its fate in spite of the actors. Mrs. Grattan played the
chief character with much tact and cleverness, singing the
vaudevilles charmingly&mdash;a most difficult task, we should say,
on account of the adapter, in putting English words to French
music, having ignorantly mis-accentuated a large majority of them.
Miss Terrey infused into a simple country girl a degree of
character which shews that she has not yet fallen into the
vampire-trap of too many young performers&mdash;stage
conventionalism, and that she copies from Nature. It is unfortunate
for both these clever actresses that they have been thrust into a
piece, which not even their talents could save from partial
&mdash;&mdash;, but it is a naughty word, and Mrs. Judy has grown
very strict. The piece wants <em>cur</em>-tailment; which, if
previously applied, will increase the interest, and make it,
perhaps, an endurable dramatic</p>

<h3>PROMENADE CONCERTS.</h3>
<p>The conductor of these concerts has not a single requisite for
his office&mdash;he is several degrees less personable than M.
Jullien&mdash;he does not even wear moustaches! and to suppose that
a man can beat time properly without them is ridiculous. He looks a
great deal more like a modest, respectable grocer, than a man of
genius; for he neither turns up his eyes nor his cuffs, and has the
indecency to appear without white gloves! His manners, too, are an
insult to the lovers of the thunder and lightning school of music;
he neither conducts himself, nor his band, with the least grace or
<em>&eacute;clat</em>. He does not spread out both arms like a
goose that wants to fly, while hushing down a <em>diminuendo</em>;
nor gesticulate like a madman during the fortes; in short, he only
gives out the time in passages where the players threaten
unsteadiness; and as that is very seldom, those amateurs who pay
their money only for the pleasure of seeing the
<em>b&acirc;ton</em> flourished about, are defrauded of half their
amusement. M. Musard takes them in&mdash;for it must be evident,
even to them, that what we have said is true, and that he possesses
scarcely a qualification for the office he holds&mdash;if we make
one trifling exception (hardly worth mentioning)&mdash;for he is
nothing more than, merely, a first-rate musician. With this single
accomplishment, it is like his impudence to try and foist himself
upon the Cockney <em>dilettanti</em> after M. Jullien, who
possessed every other requisite for a conductor <em>but</em> a
knowledge of the science; which is, after all, a paltry
acquirement, and purely mechanical.</p>
<p>On the evening PUNCH was present, the usual dose of quadrilles
and waltzes was administered, with an admixture from the dull
scores of Beethoven. Disgusted as we were at the humbug of
performing the works of this master without blue-fire, and an
artificial storm in the flies, yet&mdash;may we confess
it?&mdash;we were nearly as much charmed by the
&ldquo;Andante&rdquo; from his Symphonia in A, as if the lights had
been put out to give it effect. We blush for our taste, but thank
our <em>stars</em> (Jullien included) that we have the courage to
own the soft impeachment in the face of an enlightened Concert
d&rsquo;Et&eacute; patronising public. In sober truth, we were
ravished! The pianos of this movement were so exquisitely kept, the
<em>ensemble</em> of them was so complete, the wind instruments
were blown so exactly in tune, so evenly in tone, that the whole
passion of that touching andante seemed to be felt by the entire
band, which <em>went</em> as one instrument. The
subject&mdash;breaking in as it does, when least expected, and
worked about through nearly every part of the score, so as to
produce the most delicious effects&mdash;was played with equal
delicacy and feeling by every performer who had to take it up;
while the under-current of accompaniment was made to blend with it
with a masterly command and unanimity of tone, that we cannot
remember to have heard equalled.</p>
<p>Of course, this piece, though it enchanted the musical part of
the audience, disgusted the promenaders, and was received but
coldly. This, however, was made up for when the drumming, smashing,
and brass-blurting of the overture to &ldquo;Zampa&rdquo; was
noised forth: this was encored with ecstacies, and so were some of
the quadrilles. Happy musical taste! Beethoven&rsquo;s septour,
arranged as a set of quadrilles, is a desecration unworthy of
Musard. For this piece of bad taste he ought to be condemned to
arrange the sailor&rsquo;s hornpipe, as</p>

<h3>THE WAR WITH CHINA.</h3>
<p>The celebrated pranks of the &ldquo;Bull in the China
Shop&rdquo; are likely to be repeated on a grand scale&mdash;the
part of the Bull being undertaken, on this occasion, by the
illustrious John who is at the head of the family.</p>
<p>The Emperor, when the last advices left, was discussing a
<em>chop</em>, surrounded by all his ministers. The chop, which was
dished up with a good deal of Chinese sauce, was ultimately
forwarded to Elliot. The custom of sending chops to an enemy is
founded on the idea, that the fact of there being a bone to pick
cannot be conveyed with more delicacy than &ldquo;by wrapping it
up,&rdquo; as it is commonly termed, as politely as possible.</p>
<p>Our readers will be surprised to hear that the Chinese have
attacked our forces with <em>junk</em>, from which it has been
supposed that our brave tars have been pitched into with large
pieces of salt beef, while the English commanders have been pelted
with <em>chops</em>; but this is an error. The thing called
<em>junk</em> is not the article of that name used in the Royal
Navy, but a gimcrack attempt at a vessel, built principally of that
sort of material, something between wood and paper, of which we in
this country manufacture hat-boxes.</p>
<p>The Emperor is such a devil of a fellow, that those about him
are afraid to tell him the truth; and though his troops have been
most unmercifully wallopped, he has been humbugged into the belief
that they have achieved a victory. A poor devil named Ke-shin, who
happened to suggest the necessity for a stronger force, was
instantly split up by order of the Emperor, who can now and then do
things by halves, though such is not his ordinary custom.</p>
<p>We have sent out a correspondent of our own to China, who will
supply us with the earliest intelligence.</p>

<p>The sympathies of a charitable and witty public are earnestly
solicited in behalf of</p>
<p>JOHN WILSON CROKER, Esq., late Secretary to the Admiralty,
author of the &ldquo;New Whig Guide,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c., who,
from having been considered one of the first wits of his day, is
now reduced to a state of unforeseen comic indigence. It is
earnestly hoped that this appeal will not be made in vain, and
that, by the liberal contributions of the facetious, he will be
restored to his former affluence in jokes, and that by such means
he may be able to continue his contributions to the
&ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; which have been recently refused
from their utter dulness.</p>
<p>Contributions will be thankfully received at the PUNCH office;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
